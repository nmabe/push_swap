# push_swap
 Push_swap is a sorting game that requires two programs :  push_swap : You only have two stacks to help you to sort. At first, a stack (called Stack A) contains a certain amount of unduplicated integers and a second one (Stack B) is empty. The goal is to have all the numbers sorted in increasing order in Stack A. The output of the program is a list of instructions. checker : read the instructions and execute them. It checks if Stack A is correctly sorted and Stack B empy. It sends "OK" to stdin if it is the case, otherwise it sends "KO". Instructions are pre-defined by the subject and are the only reference to measure the performance of both programs during the peer-evaluation. Of course the less, the better. There are 4 types of instructions :  push (pa, pb) : moves the first element of a stack to the beginning of the other one swap (sa, sb, ss) : swap the two first elements of a stack rotate (ra, rb, rr) : first element comes last reverse rotate (rra, rrb, rrr) : last element comes first The instruction is ignored if the instruction cannot be executed (for instance if the stack is empty).  Allowed functions : write, read, malloc, free, exit
